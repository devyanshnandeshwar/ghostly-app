| **1. Intro**        | **[Action]**: Start with the **Chrome** window open on the landing page. <br><br> Show the clean UI, the "Anonymous" branding, and the **"Start Matching"** button.                                                                                                                | "Hi, this is a demo of **Ghosty**, an anonymous social platform that prioritizes privacy and security. Today I'll walk you through how we handle safe, verified, yet completely anonymous user onboarding."                                               |
| **2. Identity**     | **[Action]**: Click **"Start Matching"**. <br><br> An alert/modal asks for camera precision. Allow permissions. <br><br> **Pause briefly** while the camera loads and the "Verify Identity" card appears.                                                                          | "First, we solve the biggest problem in anonymous chat: bots and catfishing. We use a custom **AI Verification Service** that runs locally. It detects if a user is real and classifies gender using a neural network, without _ever_ saving your photo." |
| **3. Verification** | **[Action]**: Click **"Capture & Verify"**. <br><br> The system processes for a second. <br> Show the green **"Verified: Male/Female"** checkmark appearing. <br><br> Enter a nickname (e.g., "GhostUser") and a short bio. Click **"Join Queue"**.                                | "As you can see, the verification is instant. The image is processed in memory and immediately discarded—ensuring zero data persistence. Once verified, I create a temporary session ID which is stored securely."                                        |
| **4. Matching**     | **[Action]**: Switch to **Firefox**. Repeat the process quickly (or have it pre-verified). <br><br> Name this user "FirefoxUser". <br><br> Click **"Join Queue"**. <br><br> **[Crucial]**: Switch back to **Chrome** to show the "Match Found" screen appearing instantly on both. | "Now, let’s bring in a second user. Our matchmaking engine connects users based on verification status and preferences. Notice how as soon as the second user joins, the socket server instantly pairs them in a private room."                           |
| **5. Chat & E2EE**  | **[Action]**: Type "Hello!" in Chrome. Show it appear in Firefox. <br><br> Type back from Firefox. <br><br> Hover over the **"Encrypted"** shield icon (if available) or point to the UI.                                                                                          | "The chat you see here is secured with **End-to-End Encryption**. We use ECDH key exchange, meaning the server only relays encrypted packets—it cannot read these messages. This guarantees total privacy."                                               |
| **6. Resilience**   | **[Action]**: (Optional) Open **Brave** browser. <br><br> Show a "Waiting for match..." screen or quickly disconnect one user and show the "Partner Disconnected" message.                                                                                                         | "Behind the scenes, we've implemented robust **Crash Prevention** and **Rate Limiting** to handle high traffic and prevent abuse. Even if the AI service is heavy, the chat server remains responsive."                                                   |
| **7. Outro**        | **[Action]**: Stop the screen share or show the final "How it Works" section of the docs.                                                                                                                                                                                          | "And that’s Ghosty. A scalable, secure, and user-privacy-first application. Thanks for watching."                                                                                                                                                         |

**Tips for recording:**

- Use **Incognito mode** if you want to simulate fresh "first-time" visits easily (resets Device ID).
- Don't worry if the AI gets the gender wrong once; just retry, it adds to the "real demo" feel.
